A React UI component library inspired by "Animal Crossing: New Horizons", for learning and technical exchange only.

## Introduction

This project is a lightweight UI component library built with React + TypeScript. The design style is inspired by Nintendo's "Animal Crossing: New Horizons" game interface, created for personal front-end technical practice and component development learning.

All visual elements, layouts, icons, and animations are independently designed and implemented, without directly using any official Nintendo art materials, code, or resource files.
